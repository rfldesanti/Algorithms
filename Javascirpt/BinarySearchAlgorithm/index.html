        <h1>The Binary Search Algorithm</h1>
        <h2>This page shows the output of the binary search algorithm written in Javascript</h2>
        <h3>How does this algorithm works? Why is it called "binary search"?</h3>
        <div id="central_txt">
            <p>The <u><b>binary search algorithm</u></b> works by reducing 50% of the itens (or values)
            that must be analysed in an ordered list to find the sought value. At each time that
            the algorithm try to find the item (or the value), 50% of the itens are discarded,
            making this kind of search much more efficient than a linear search (that analyse 
            individually each value from the list to find the sought value).
